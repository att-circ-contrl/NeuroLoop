FIR filters are defined by specifying the impulse response waveform of the
filter (the response generated by an input signal with a single nonzero
sample of unit amplitude).

FIR filters are implemented using fixed-point integer operations. For an
input signal x[t], output signal y[t], n-point FIR coefficient table h[t],
and number of bits b, the filter response is:

y[t] = sum(k = 0..n-1)  x[t + k] * y[k] / 2^b

This is a causal implementation, introducing a time delay. The time delay
is known, constant, and independent of the spectral content of x[t].



FIR filter coefficients may be safed to and read from CSV files. The first
row of the file contains quoted column name strings. Subsequent rows contain
data.


The following columns must be present in the CSV file:

"bank N" contains FIR coefficients for bank N.



Additional columns may also be present. Among other uses, this makes it easy
to describe multiple filter sets in a single CSV file. The NeuroLoop FIR
import/export routines offer the option of filtering imported rows so that
only those matching specified (column name, cell value) tuples are imported.
When exporting FIR filter banks, exported rows may contain constant
(column name, cell value) tuples in addition to coefficient data.
