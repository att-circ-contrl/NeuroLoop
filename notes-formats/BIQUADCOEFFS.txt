Biquad filters are defined by numerator and denominator coefficients. The
transfer function of a biquad stage is:

H(z) = ( n0 + n1*z^-1 + n2*z^-2 ) / ( d0 + d1*z^-1 + d2*z^-2 )

IIR filter banks are implemented as cascaded biquad stages.


Biquad filter coefficients may be saved to and read from .csv files. The first
row of the file contains quoted column name strings. Subsequent rows contain
data.


The following columns must be present in the CSV file:

"bank" contains the bank index for the biquad being set (starting at 0).
"stage" contains the stage index for the biquad being set (starting at 0).
"num0", "num1", and "num2" contain integer values used as numerator
  coefficients for the biquad being set.
"den0", "den1", and "den2" contain integer values used as denominator
  coefficients for the biquad being set.

Coefficients are integers. The "den0" coefficient must be a positive power
of 2. Other coefficients may be any value in the integer samptype_t range.



Additional columns may also be present. Among other uses, this makes it easy
to describe multiple filter sets in a single CSV file. The NeuroLoop biquad
import/export routines offer the option of filtering imported rows so that
only those matching specified (column name, cell value) tuples are imported.
When exporting biquad filter banks, exported rows may contain constant
(column name, cell value) tuples in addition to coefficient data.

The "Burst Box" and "Burst Station" programs use an extra "type" field to
distinguish anti-aliasing filter coefficients from band-pass filter bank
coefficients (with "type" values of "anti-alias" and "bank", respectively).
