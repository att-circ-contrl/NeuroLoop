Biquad filters are defined by numerator and denominator coefficients. The
transfer function of a biquad stage is:

H(z) = ( n0 + n1*z^-1 + n2*z^-2 ) / ( d0 + d1*z^-1 + d2*z^-2 )

IIR filter banks are implemented as cascaded biquad stages.


Biquad filter coefficients may be saved to and read from .csv files. The first
row of the file contains quoted column name strings. Subsequent rows contain
data.


When reading, the following columns must be present (others are ignored):

"bank" contains the bank index for the biquad being set (starting at 0).
"stage" contains the stage index for the biquad being set (starting at 0).
"num0", "num1", and "num2" contain integer values used as numerator
  coefficients for the biquad being set.
"den0", "den1", and "den2" contain integer values used as denominator
  coefficients for the biquad being set.

Coefficients are integers. The "den0" coefficient must be a positive power
of 2. Other coefficients may be any value in the integer samptype_t range.


When writing, the columns described above are written. Additional
user-specified columns may be written that have a constant value in all rows.
